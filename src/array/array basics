*An array declaration has two components:
  i]the type and the name. ii]type declares the element type of the array.
  int arr[];


*Obtaining an array is a two-step process.
 i] you must declare a variable of the desired array type.
ii] you must allocate the memory to hold the array, using new, and assign it to the array variable.
   arr=new int[20];
